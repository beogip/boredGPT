AI with its unmatched information processing capabilities is changing the way we research and make decisions. Brands need to up their game, ensuring that the quality of their content and the consistency of their messaging can meet the high bar set by these digital intellects. Most of the time, research is boring and time-consuming. I think we all agree on that. So, we were pretty happy when ChatGPT came along, even happier now that it integrates web browsing, and you can use it with data beyond what it was trained with (until 2021). Instead of doing just a Google search where most of the information is just based on “top 10 articles” created for SEO positioning by the very same brands it promotes (i.e. the top 10 PM tools, written by ClickUp, or the top 10 chat widgets written by Intercom), I can just ask ChatGPT to do a deeper and more quantified research.‍Even more game changing, I can ask ChatGPT to judge the information it looked up for me with a specific user persona and use case in mind: for example, “You are a CMO in a Series B startup looking for new CRM tools that have great form integrations”. And from there, ask questions like: What makes this brand and tool better than the other ones? What do customer reviews say? Which ones are better fitting our processes? And just like that, you can not only research for tools to integrate on your company, but also as a marketer, strategist or designer, you can evaluate the impact of your own website copy and messaging.&nbsp; As a company, this means that your website now has a whole new traffic channel, potentially with higher conversion rates than organic search engine traffic, and that’s why Google is so freaking scared.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s a useful tool and super easy to use. But guess what: just because you know how to hold a hammer doesn’t mean you know how to build a house. The ease of use of ChatGPT is kind of the problem here. Most people don’t put any effort into their prompts or editing and just tell GPT to “write something”.&nbsp;‍Sure, you can tell it about your marketing goals, give it some context about your history and other stuff.

But not just because of the features or because Apple decides to slow it down with a new OS, but also based on how it feels in your hands? Well, that’s commonly known as “perceived obsolescence”.‍Of course, this is fueled (and abused) by marketing teams that emphasize the new features or say things like “This is the fastest phone we have ever made” (even though it clearly has to be, it’s the new one). But beyond that, as a human race, we are driven by a constant desire for progress, improvement, and innovation.

This access to a new way of building has expanded the pool of creators and lowered the barrier to entry for developing digital products. Even template marketplaces have raised the bar!‍AI, particularly in the generative AI side, has made significant contributions in pushing the boundaries of quality and creativity. In case you are unfamiliar, generative AI refers to AI models and algorithms that can create new content or designs, such as images, artwork, or even UI designs. For example, Midjourney is creating images that only the best artists, illustrators, and 3D designers in the industry would even be able to dream of. And you can even generate Websites and UI designs that a few years (or even months) ago were top quality.‍These technologies are pushing companies to up their game. Having brands and websites that look OK is already perceived as old and outdated, and it will get worse, directly affecting brand positioning, engagement, and conversion. A great brand and website are already the bottom line. Here are a few quick outputs from Midjourney (which is not even designed to create websites):‍//midjourney image‍If your website is looking any closer to this, your company is going to be beginning to be perceived as outdated, boring, and standard.

By now, no one should doubt the paradigm shifts it will cause across every industry. Along with it, we should ask ourselves, how do we define value in this new era?‍As AI’s capabilities increase and are accessed by more and more people, the relevance of tech companies declines correspondingly. Why?‍Well, we can already see glimpses of it. AutoGPT is an AI bot that can be deployed to fulfil simple tasks. Set it up once, and it can sort your emails, even answer some of them. You can also let it browse the internet for you and scrape data. Remember, this is one, really easy to set up and cheap tool, replacing services that received a lot of funding just a few years ago.‍The craziest part about it: AutoGPT is an “AI Agent” meaning that you don’t need to \"prompt\" it, you just need to provide a goal in natural language, and it will autonomously break it into subtasks and use any tools at its disposal to reach the goal.‍Anything that can be done digitally will soon be done in a fraction of the time, and eventually become free to produce. Yep, the production cost of digital products is on a steep trajectory towards zero.‍We are even seeing that evolution now with No-code tools like Webflow, which is also integrating AI really aggressively. The advancement of No-code as visual development tools will soon move from no-code to no-interface, allowing users to create complete digital products, tools, and even websites with prompts; basically text to digital product as we see nowadays for text to image, text to code, text to music and much more.‍So, what is value, then, in this new era?‍In a world dominated by AI and technology, the value will lie not in the software, but in the experiences we create and the very human connections we form. Not just as individuals, but also as brands.‍We are moving from an age where knowing how to code, how to design, and how to build was glorified, into an age where it won’t matter at all.

But uniqueness comes from innovation, and the only way to break through into innovative communication is with deep exploration and iteration. Only when teams can test different solutions, explore opposing ideas, and conceptualize divergent solutions, do uniqueness starts to emerge - paving the way to create better experiences.‍But, what are we calling \"better experiences,\" and why is this such a big deal? In the world of digital marketing, \"better experiences\" really just means creating moments that are special and personal for each user, that touch them emotionally, and that clearly reflect what the brand is all about. These special moments help people recognize and remember, and build a strong emotional connection between them and the brand. But what's really cool is that these moments aren't just about buying or using a product or service. They're about the journey each person goes on, and how that journey leaves them feeling good about the brand.‍In other words, the power of iteration lies in understanding that the more time you spend trying to define a brand, create a website, or conceptualize a campaign, the closer you get to innovative solutions.‍“It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer.” - Albert Einstein‍But how do you spend more time when you are expected to do even more with less time? How do you push for uniqueness in a market where launching a week later could mean a heavy hit on revenue and market positioning? That’s where AI plays a unique role and gives an unfair advantage to those who can truly harness its power.‍The iterative power of AI helps brands move faster through iteration, allowing them to explore different variations of an idea, or even entire new concepts, in a fraction of the time. For example, designers can change backgrounds on a website hero, or test different styles from 3d, sketches, artistic, and more by just using a prompt in Midjourney. And the best part is that this process is not about moving quick and dirty, this process is all about fast-forwarding innovation by speeding up iteration.‍Tools like Midjourney, Dall-E, and other generative AI, which are used to create images, can be applied in a wide variety of ways, ranging from finding inspiration to creating mood boards. Our mood boards typically focus more on how the website should feel, so these tools are excellent for discovering concepts beyond UI elements. Here is an example:‍// Add moodboard created with Midjourney images.‍Beyond generative AI, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have the capability to serve as brainstorming companions, where you can exchange ideas, research concepts from different fields that could bring inspiration into design, experiment with various content, and more.

This is where no-code empowers large brands and agencies to move faster and still deliver at the highest industry standards. It’s a tool for professional teams to build more efficiently, allowing them to deliver better experiences by reducing development cycles and pain points.‍“No-code will forever be a misnomer. Its name implies a removal of technical limitations, but in reality, the promise has always been about what could be done if those barriers to entry were replaced with bridges.” - Max Lind, Senior Marketing Manager at Webflow‍No-code is not a movement, a hot new thing, or a boy band from the 90s. At its core, no-code is just a cool name for what’s been happening in the tech world since its very beginning: the continuous evolution of code environments to create better experiences - faster.‍Let me break that down for you:‍No-code is not an overnight technology; it’s not even a new practice! For years, engineers have been using frameworks, components, and even AI to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written. There have been multiple solutions that would today fit the term “No-code”, that at that time, were just unlabelled, cool, tricks.‍What changed is that really cool tools (like Webflow, Bubble, Voiceflow, Retool, and more) are speeding up that evolution by delivering visual development environments. With these, building experiences that output great code standards and follow the best development practices is a commodity.‍Yes, you read it right. No-code tools are coding environments. I know! They lied to you all this time! When you build using no-code, you are still building with code, you’re just doing it – mostly – visually.‍Instead of thinking of no-code tools as literally containing no code, think of them instead as hidden-code tools. You’re still building with code, you’re just not directly exposed to it. You don’t see the code, but it’s there. And most importantly, you are responsible for its quality.‍So, if you’re going to use no-code tools like Webflow as a professional, you must know how code works.

When we talk about speed, we talk about prototyping, and what we really mean is: we can create a lot of prototypes in a short period of time.‍No-Code tools like Webflow allow us to rapidly visualize our ideas and test their behavior. It allows us to make changes on the go, and preview them visually in seconds. With that amazing power, we can always strive for excellence without the constraints of time and traditional development**'s** extensive development cycles.‍The benefit of this is easy to grasp, let’s take something super simple: it’s far easier to communicate and refine something like a GSAP text animation by simply showing it, instead of talking about duration and stagger numbers (we even made a tool for that). Show vs tell, all the way. This accelerated visualization and feedback loop empowers teams from design and development to create and compare multiple design iterations super-fast, getting to refine those text animations to the millisecond and achieving the perfect sweet spot where it feels just right.‍On top of that, this whole iteration to refine and elevate the quality saves time. I know, crazy! And that saved time doesn't simply disappear; it's reinvested into the process of iteration, enabling creative teams to continuously refine the experience. And not merely revising, but reimagining and reinventing, transforming each iteration into a new opportunity for improvement. This is a critical shift. Instead of being limited by time constraints, the creative process is liberated, enabling relentless pursuit of the best possible version of the product.‍This process of rapid iteration breeds an environment of constant innovation. As each iteration builds upon the last, it feeds a cycle of continuous improvement, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in digital experiences. And that’s how to create award-winning stuff that engages and creates connections with customers.‍Adopting no-code visual development is an investment in building better digital experiences, pushing boundaries on quality without sacrificing on time to market.

My go-to until now has been recording the calls, and then making a few bullet summary or a Loom to share with the team and create a common understanding. But nowadays, and thanks to the power of AI, there are much better ways.‍I always dreamt of a tool that could search and summarize conversations, like direct access to my brain as a searchable database. Well, for calls, these now exist. They call it an “AI meeting assistant” and there are a few of them. The best ones I’ve tried are Fireflies.ai, Other.ai, and tl;dv, but there are new ones coming every day. The system is quite easy, they all record a transcript and then use GPT to analyze the transcript, create summaries, extract action items, or execute your prompts. The summaries are kind of okay, but they miss a lot of the point of the call and give you summaries about how the weather is or other casual conversations you have. So, to get better insights, it is crucial to prompt the AI assistant to get specific summaries. i.e., for sales calls, I use these two prompts:‍Make a summary of what the client is looking for in this project in terms of scope and services. Highlight the key goal of the client and their definition of success in the context of this project.Extract the following information and present it in bullets. The information should be supported and presented with quotes from the call: Desired Project Start and End Date, Budget, Number and Type of Pages, Integrations, Visual Direction, Key Project Goals considerations.But besides this, you can also ask stuff about the call like “did they define a budget?” or “when are they ready to start?” to get back to it when you are crafting proposals. This, for me, is the most helpful part. Because instead of searching the whole transcript where you maybe touch on the same topic in different parts of the call, you can now just search for key answers across the whole conversation.‍So why is this a game changer? The key part of this is that it allows us to have a shared understanding, which leads to better decision making and more informed strategic planning. There is nothing lost in translation, there is nothing forgotten, it’s like having a perfect meeting memory.‍"}]
