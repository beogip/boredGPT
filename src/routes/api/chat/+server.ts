			"We all know the power of note-taking: when done correctly, it helps us track all the important details and decisions while also aiding in onboarding our team and keeping everyone in the loop.‍But when I’m on a discovery call, I want to create an experience, and excessive note-taking ends up either interrupting the flow of the call or giving a weird feeling of an interview instead of a collaborative environment. My go-to until now has been recording the calls, and then making a few bullet summary or a Loom to share with the team and create a common understanding. But nowadays, and thanks to the power of AI, there are much better ways.‍I always dreamt of a tool that could search and summarize conversations, like direct access to my brain as a searchable database. Well, for calls, these now exist. They call it an “AI meeting assistant” and there are a few of them. The best ones I’ve tried are Fireflies.ai, Other.ai, and tl;dv, but there are new ones coming every day. The system is quite easy, they all record a transcript and then use GPT to analyze the transcript, create summaries, extract action items, or execute your prompts. The summaries are kind of okay, but they miss a lot of the point of the call and give you summaries about how the weather is or other casual conversations you have. So, to get better insights, it is crucial to prompt the AI assistant to get specific summaries. i.e., for sales calls, I use these two prompts:‍Make a summary of what the client is looking for in this project in terms of scope and services. Highlight the key goal of the client and their definition of success in the context of this project.Extract the following information and present it in bullets. The information should be supported and presented with quotes from the call: Desired Project Start and End Date, Budget, Number and Type of Pages, Integrations, Visual Direction, Key Project Goals considerations.But besides this, you can also ask stuff about the call like “did they define a budget?” or “when are they ready to start?” to get back to it when you are crafting proposals. This, for me, is the most helpful part. Because instead of searching the whole transcript where you maybe touch on the same topic in different parts of the call, you can now just search for key answers across the whole conversation.‍So why is this a game changer? The key part of this is that it allows us to have a shared understanding, which leads to better decision making and more informed strategic planning. There is nothing lost in translation, there is nothing forgotten, it’s like having a perfect meeting memory.‍"

				"The no-code movement is more than a simple toy for tech enthusiasts, it is a step in the digital evolution aiming to improve processes and the quality of products. How? With speed.‍No, we don’t mean we just drag and drop a full website into existence, it is not there yet (not even close). When we talk about speed, we talk about prototyping, and what we really mean is: we can create a lot of prototypes in a short period of time.‍No-Code tools like Webflow allow us to rapidly visualize our ideas and test their behavior. It allows us to make changes on the go, and preview them visually in seconds. With that amazing power, we can always strive for excellence without the constraints of time and traditional development**'s** extensive development cycles.‍The benefit of this is easy to grasp, let’s take something super simple: it’s far easier to communicate and refine something like a GSAP text animation by simply showing it, instead of talking about duration and stagger numbers (we even made a tool for that). Show vs tell, all the way. This accelerated visualization and feedback loop empowers teams from design and development to create and compare multiple design iterations super-fast, getting to refine those text animations to the millisecond and achieving the perfect sweet spot where it feels just right.‍On top of that, this whole iteration to refine and elevate the quality saves time. I know, crazy! And that saved time doesn't simply disappear; it's reinvested into the process of iteration, enabling creative teams to continuously refine the experience. And not merely revising, but reimagining and reinventing, transforming each iteration into a new opportunity for improvement. This is a critical shift. Instead of being limited by time constraints, the creative process is liberated, enabling relentless pursuit of the best possible version of the product.‍This process of rapid iteration breeds an environment of constant innovation. As each iteration builds upon the last, it feeds a cycle of continuous improvement, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in digital experiences. And that’s how to create award-winning stuff that engages and creates connections with customers.‍Adopting no-code visual development is an investment in building better digital experiences, pushing boundaries on quality without sacrificing on time to market. This results in a domino effect. The enhanced digital experiences echo throughout the business, increasing the metrics everywhere; from improved customer engagement, brand recognition, conversion rates, and sales metrics. Ultimately, all of this translates to being more successful as a company, gaining speed and keeping quality up. Or as we like to say: No-Code, no-compromises.‍"

			"The most popular side of no-code is the “democratization of code”. This democratization of code empowers people without any technical training or knowledge to build digital experiences themselves, all while avoiding the need to bring in a team of experts.‍This is incredibly useful for small business owners, first-time entrepreneurs, or intrapreneurs who want to speed up their go-to-market and launch something quickly and efficiently that does the job, to an extent.‍On the other side of no-code is the “visual development” angle. This is where no-code empowers large brands and agencies to move faster and still deliver at the highest industry standards. It’s a tool for professional teams to build more efficiently, allowing them to deliver better experiences by reducing development cycles and pain points.‍“No-code will forever be a misnomer. Its name implies a removal of technical limitations, but in reality, the promise has always been about what could be done if those barriers to entry were replaced with bridges.” - Max Lind, Senior Marketing Manager at Webflow‍No-code is not a movement, a hot new thing, or a boy band from the 90s. At its core, no-code is just a cool name for what’s been happening in the tech world since its very beginning: the continuous evolution of code environments to create better experiences - faster.‍Let me break that down for you:‍No-code is not an overnight technology; it’s not even a new practice! For years, engineers have been using frameworks, components, and even AI to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written. There have been multiple solutions that would today fit the term “No-code”, that at that time, were just unlabelled, cool, tricks.‍What changed is that really cool tools (like Webflow, Bubble, Voiceflow, Retool, and more) are speeding up that evolution by delivering visual development environments. With these, building experiences that output great code standards and follow the best development practices is a commodity.‍Yes, you read it right. No-code tools are coding environments. I know! They lied to you all this time! When you build using no-code, you are still building with code, you’re just doing it – mostly – visually.‍Instead of thinking of no-code tools as literally containing no code, think of them instead as hidden-code tools. You’re still building with code, you’re just not directly exposed to it. You don’t see the code, but it’s there. And most importantly, you are responsible for its quality.‍So, if you’re going to use no-code tools like Webflow as a professional, you must know how code works. It’s not optional or a nice-to-have — it’s a must. ‍"

				"In a world where everything looks the same, uniqueness is the only weapon marketers have to win over competition. But uniqueness comes from innovation, and the only way to break through into innovative communication is with deep exploration and iteration. Only when teams can test different solutions, explore opposing ideas, and conceptualize divergent solutions, do uniqueness starts to emerge - paving the way to create better experiences.‍But, what are we calling "better experiences," and why is this such a big deal? In the world of digital marketing, "better experiences" really just means creating moments that are special and personal for each user, that touch them emotionally, and that clearly reflect what the brand is all about. These special moments help people recognize and remember, and build a strong emotional connection between them and the brand. But what's really cool is that these moments aren't just about buying or using a product or service. They're about the journey each person goes on, and how that journey leaves them feeling good about the brand.‍In other words, the power of iteration lies in understanding that the more time you spend trying to define a brand, create a website, or conceptualize a campaign, the closer you get to innovative solutions.‍“It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer.” - Albert Einstein‍But how do you spend more time when you are expected to do even more with less time? How do you push for uniqueness in a market where launching a week later could mean a heavy hit on revenue and market positioning? That’s where AI plays a unique role and gives an unfair advantage to those who can truly harness its power.‍The iterative power of AI helps brands move faster through iteration, allowing them to explore different variations of an idea, or even entire new concepts, in a fraction of the time. For example, designers can change backgrounds on a website hero, or test different styles from 3d, sketches, artistic, and more by just using a prompt in Midjourney. And the best part is that this process is not about moving quick and dirty, this process is all about fast-forwarding innovation by speeding up iteration.‍Tools like Midjourney, Dall-E, and other generative AI, which are used to create images, can be applied in a wide variety of ways, ranging from finding inspiration to creating mood boards. Our mood boards typically focus more on how the website should feel, so these tools are excellent for discovering concepts beyond UI elements. Here is an example:‍// Add moodboard created with Midjourney images.‍Beyond generative AI, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have the capability to serve as brainstorming companions, where you can exchange ideas, research concepts from different fields that could bring inspiration into design, experiment with various content, and more. And beyond even that there are breathtaking things being researched and developed like DragGAN, which lets you manipulate images by just dragging them, Flawless, that lets you change the language or edit scripts of videos while manipulating expressions and lips movements, or Blockade Labs, that allows you to create 3d environments with doodles. ‍But moving deeper into iteration, you can feel there is a new wave of AI breakthroughs that are changing how we work. Like Google with Style Drop, that turns images into text, but in any style you pick from a reference image. Or Spline with AI Style Transfer, which lets you changes the style of 3D designs in seconds.‍Update: Introducing AI Style Transfer for 3d scenes with Spline‍There is so much coming up to keep empowering design iteration and keep pushing the boundaries of the experiences we can create!‍"
